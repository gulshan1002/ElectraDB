# OOPS_Project

## Project Overview
This project is a **Database Management System** for an **Election Commission**, implemented using Java and MySQL. It demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts, effective database integration, and robust error-handling mechanisms.

## Features
1. **Database Integration**:
   - Built using **MySQL** for data storage and management.
   - Utilizes **JDBC drivers** for establishing and managing connections between the application and the database.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Implements Java's `Exception` handling mechanisms to manage runtime errors effectively.
   - Includes `Try-Catch` blocks for debugging and preventing application crashes.

3. **Object-Oriented Design**:
   - Follows fundamental OOP principles like **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, and **Encapsulation** for maintainable and scalable code.
   - Designed with modularity in mind for better code structure and reusability.

4. **Core Java Features**:
   - Leverages Java Collections Framework for data manipulation.
   - Uses file handling to store and retrieve additional data as required.

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Java
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Driver**: JDBC
- **IDE**: Any Java-supported IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.)
